## What are Webhooks?

Webhooks are automated messages sent from apps when something happens. In the context of Argil, webhooks allow you to receive real-time notifications about various events occurring within your environment, such as video generation successes and failures or avatar training successes and failures.

## How Webhooks Work

Webhooks in Argil send a POST request to your specified callback URL whenever subscribed events occur. This enables your applications to respond immediately to events within Argil as they happen.
