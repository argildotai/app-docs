    ```mermaid
    flowchart TB
        subgraph project["Video project {name}"]
            direction LR
              subgraph subgraph1["Moment 1"]
                  direction LR
                  item1{{avatar}}
                  item2{{voice}}
                  item3{{transcript}}
              end
              subgraph subgraph2["Moment 2"]
                  direction LR
                  item4{{avatar}}
                  item5{{voice}}
                  item6{{transcript}}
              end
              subgraph subgraph3["Moment n"]
                  direction LR
                  item7{{avatar}}
                  item8{{voice}}
                  item9{{transcript}}
              end
              subgraph1 --> subgraph2
              subgraph2 --> subgraph3

    For each moment, you will be able to choose the avatar, the voice and the transcript to be used.
