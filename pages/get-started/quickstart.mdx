<Steps>
  <Step icon="magnifying-glass" title="Get a look at your avatar and voice resources">
    In order to generate your first video through our API, you'll need to know which avatar and voice you want to use.
    <Note>
      Not finding your Avatar? It might not be ready yet. Check at your [Avatars](https://app.argil.ai/avatars) page for updates.
    </Note>

      <Accordion icon="user" title="Check your available avatars">
        Get your avatars list by running a GET request on the `/avatars` route.
        <Tip>
          Check the [Avatars API Reference](/api-reference/endpoint/avatars.list) to run the request using an interactive UI.
        </Tip>
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion icon="microphone" title="Check your available voices">
        Get your voices list by running a GET request on the `/voices` route.
        <Tip>
          Check the [Voices API Reference](/api-reference/endpoint/voices.list) to run the request using an interactive UI.
        </Tip>

    <Check>
      You are done with this step if you have the id of the avatar and and the id of the voice you want to use for the next steps.

  </Step>
  <Step icon="square-plus" title="Create a video">
    Create a video by running a POST request on the `/videos` route.

    <Tip>
      Check the [Video creation API Reference](/api-reference/endpoint/videos.create) to run the request using an interactive UI.
    </Tip>

    To create a `Video` resource, you'll need:
    - A `name` for the video
    - A list of `Moment` objects, representing segments of your final video. For each moment, you will be able to choose the `avatar`, the `voice` and the `transcript` to be used.

    <Tip>
        For each moment, you can also optionally specify:
        - An audioUrl to be used as voice for the moment. This audio will override our voice generation.
        - A gestureSlug to select which gesture from the avatar should be used for the moment. 
    </Tip>
