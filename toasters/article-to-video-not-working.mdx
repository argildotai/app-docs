1\) Check if the link you sent is a blog/article link (no videos, etc.)&#x20;

2\) Check that the article you sent isn't behind a paywall, a login window or a big cookie popup

Sometimes, websites can detect that there is a bot visiting their page and therefore don't allow us to access the content.&#x20;
