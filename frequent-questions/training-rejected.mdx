* Incorrect face position : weird camera angles, face half cut, etc.&#x20;

* Hand or objects in front of your mouth: if anything moves in the area from your chin to your nose, this will mess up the lip sync

* Video edited or contains cuts: zooms, transitions and a big amount of cuts (more than 3 per minute)&#x20;

* Insufficient video quality: when it is too bad to generate satisfying results (recomended: 1080p and good lighting)

* Insufficient sound quality: when it is too bad to generate satisfying results, too much background noise (AC, traffic, etc.)

* Incorrect distance from camera: don't record yourself from 10 meters away or so close to the camera that your face takes up the whole space

* Other people in the video
