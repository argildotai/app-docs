### What is a style?

Styles are keeping your face appearance while putting you in different environments, actions, or clothes. You can full prompt the style you want for your avatar. Each time you upload an image, we offer you a range of avatar styles you can pick from.

<Tip>
  You can edit any style, like the color of a shirt or a hair cut. [Learn how here.](https://docs.argil.ai/resources/edit-avatar-styles)
</Tip>

### How to create a style?

When you are in the avatar tab, you can either hover over avatar cards and click on "New style" or click on the avatar image and then click on "New syle".

Then you will be able to describe in full where you want to be standing, what you are wearing, the light, etc.

Last step is to pick whether you want a vertical avatar or a horizontal one and pay a few credits to generate the image.
