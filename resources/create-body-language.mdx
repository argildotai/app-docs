<Note>
  Our model requires pre-recorded gestures - all body language must be shot in the training video following the process below.
</Note>

### Recording your training video

<Steps>
  <Step title="Think about the gestures you want to do">
    Select the gestures or expressions you want to add to your avatar. We recommand between 3 and 9 gestures.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Record each gesture (20 seconds each minimum)">
    Perform the gesture once clearly (e.g., waving hello)

    1. Return hands to neutral position
    2. Continue speaking naturally until the 20-second mark

  </Step>
  <Step title="Record your base video">
    Record a 2-minute base video of natural talking. The goal is to have a solid base that goes with everything you say. It is the "neutral you". 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create the full training video">
    1. Blend your base 2-minute video with the gestures videos (3 to 9) together in an editor like Capcut. 
    2. Each gesture should appear at 20-second intervals after the 2-minute mark
    3. Result should look like a short version of this: [Watch an example training video](https://youtu.be/_MltcxXAADw)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload for training">
    Navigate to Avatars -\> Create a new avatar -\> Generic avatars and follow the training steps.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Labeling gestures

<Tip>
  Label your gestures immediately after training to make them available in the studio. Use the left/right arrows to adjust the exact timing of each gesture.
</Tip>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open avatar settings">
    1. Go to Avatars
    2. Select your avatar
    3. Click "..." then "Edit" on the right camera
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add gesture labels">
    1. Play the video until your first gesture (around 2-minute mark)
    2. Click "Add gesture"
    3. Name your gesture (e.g., "Waving")
    4. Repeat for each gesture in the video
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Using gestures in the studio

<Note>
  Your labeled gestures will appear in the "Body language" tab when creating videos. Select different gestures for each clip as needed.
