### What does "Edit style" do?

Variations allow you to add any product to your avatar or simply edit any aspect of the picture, whether it is the color of a shirt, the position of the hands or the background.

<u>Major benefits:</u>

- if you have created a style your are 95% satisfied with, you can still edit it later within Argil
- you can develop a whole branding easily around your avatar

**In the "Avatars" tab section, you can click on any avatar \> click on "Edit style".**
