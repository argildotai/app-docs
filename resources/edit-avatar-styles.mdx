### What does "Edit style" do?

Variations allow you to add any product to your avatar or simply edit any aspect of the picture, whether it is the color of a shirt, the position of the hands or the background.

**In the "Avatars" tab section, you can click on any avatar \> click on "Edit style".**

Then you can add your instructions.

You can operate slight variations of your avatar like this.
