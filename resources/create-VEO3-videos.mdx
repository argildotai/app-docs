<Steps>
  <Step title="Prompt">
    In Prompt, describe exactly what the camera sees and what happens during the 8 seconds.

    Prompt tips that work well\
    • State camera first: “handheld close-up,” “tripod medium-wide,” “slow dolly-in,” “static 3/4 angle.”\
    • Give one clear action that fits in 8 seconds.\
    • Name the setting and time of day; add simple lighting notes.\
    • If framing matters, say what’s in frame (e.g., “waist-up,” “full body,” “subject off-center left”).\
    • Keep it realistic; avoid vague adjectives.

    The more precise your prompt is, the more likely it is to look as you want.
