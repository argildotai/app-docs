  <Step title="Magic editing: pick your options">
    You can chose to toggle captions, B-rolls and a background music to have a pre-edited video rapidly. You can modify all of those in the studio.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Preview and edit your video">
    You can press the "Play" button to preview the video. You can edit your script, B-rolls, captions, background, voice, music and body language.\
    **Note that lipsync hasn't been generated yet, hence the blur of the preview.**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate the video">
    This is when you spend some of your credits to generate the lipsync of the avatar. This process takes between 5 and 15 minutes depending on the length of the video and your plan. Pro plans have a faster generation time.
