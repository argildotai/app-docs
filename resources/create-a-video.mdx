  <Step title="Magic editing: pick your options" stepNumber="1">
    You can chose to toggle captions, B-rolls and a background music to have a pre-edited video rapidly. You can modify all of those in the studio. 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Preview and edit your video">
    You can press the "Play" button to preview the video. You can edit your script, B-rolls, captions, background, voice, music and body language. 
    **Note that lipsync hasn't been generated yet, hence the blur of the preview.** 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate the video">
    This is when you spend some of your credits to generate the lipsync of the avatar. This process takes between 6 and 12 minutes depending on the length of the video.
