### Frequently asked questions

<Note>
  Avatar Royalties only apply to Argil's avatars - if you train your own avatar, you will not pay for it
</Note>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I avoid paying for voice?" defaultOpen={false}>
    Yes, we have a partnership with [Elevenlabs](https://elevenlabs.io/) for voice. If you have an account there with your voices, you can link your Elevenlabs account to Argil (see how here) and you will not pay for voice using the API.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the &#x22;avatar royalty&#x22;?" defaultOpen={false}>
    At Argil, we are commited to give our actors (generic avatars) their fair share - we thus have a royalty system in place with them. By measure of transparency and since it may evolve, we're adding it as a separate pricing for awareness.&#x20;
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why do I need to subscribe to a plan for the API?" defaultOpen={false}>
