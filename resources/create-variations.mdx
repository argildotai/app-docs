## Hook variation

A/B test alternate opening lines. Generate a few short intro variants while the rest of the video stays the same, then use the intro that gets the best attention.

## Language variation

Instantly translate your video into 30+ languages while keeping the same voice and avatar. Produces a new version per language chosen with synced speech/captions so you can publish region-specific cuts.

## Avatar variation

Re-render the same video with different presenters or visual looks. Great to see which persona/style fits your message best without rewriting your script. Pick a few options, generate, and keep the winner.
