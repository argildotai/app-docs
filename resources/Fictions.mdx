Fictions allow you to fully prompt 8 second-clips using the latest AI video models with a frame of reference. [AI influencers created in the builder used to allow you to do that](https://docs.argil.ai/resources/ai-influencer-actions), but this is now possible on every human based avatar.

### How to store and reuse those videos?

In Prompt, describe exactly what the camera sees and what happens during the 8 seconds.

Prompt tips that work well\
• State camera first: “handheld close-up,” “tripod medium-wide,” “slow dolly-in,” “static 3/4 angle.”\
• Give one clear action that fits in 8 seconds.\
• Name the setting and time of day; add simple lighting notes.\
• If framing matters, say what’s in frame (e.g., “waist-up,” “full body,” “subject off-center left”).\
• Keep it realistic; avoid vague adjectives.

The more precise your prompt is, the more likely it is to look as you want.

<Tip>
  If you want to reuse those shots in your avatar videos, they will appear in the "assets" tab and saty available in the studio when uploading files.
