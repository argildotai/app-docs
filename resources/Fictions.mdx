Fictions allow you to fully prompt 8 second-clips using the latest AI video models with a frame of reference. [AI influencers created in the builder used to allow you to do that](https://docs.argil.ai/resources/ai-influencer-actions), but this is now possible on every human based avatar.

### How to create a Fiction video?

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select the Fictions menu">
    ![Captured‚ÄôeÃÅcran2025 08 19aÃÄ23 38 24 Pn](/images/Captured‚ÄôeÃÅcran2025-08-19aÃÄ23.38.24.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload your image or pick an avatar from the list">
    You can put in any picture of your choice or pick from the list of avatars from the platform (your own or Argil's). We will keep the different characteristics of the face being sent so you can be sure the ressemblance stays here\!
  </Step>
  <Step title="Change the settings">
    **Model**: You can pick between Veo3 Fast and Normal. Fast works perfectly fine for simple scenes. For scenes with a lot of people, a lot of cuts going on, Normal will work best.\
    **Sound on: **decide if you want to receive a video with sound\
    **Selected voice for this video: **if you want your avatar to keep the same voice as usual, pick the voice from the platform. Otherwise, you can delete the voice and let Veo3 pick the voice. <u>No matter your choice, we will always keep the sound effects. </u>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Prompt your scene (example at the bottom)">
    Regarding the prompting, you can always do a one-liner. \
    What we advise you to do is give indications for the following: \
    **Advised indications: **Subject, Setting, Actions, Camera and Audio.  \
    **Bonus indications: **lighting and constraints
  </Step>
  <Step title="Re-use a prompt and the first frame">
    Once a video is generated, hover your mouse over it to see the "Remix" button. It will allow you to reuse the same prompting, same voices and same first frame (that you can decide to delete to start from scratch). 
  </Step>
</Steps>


### How to store and reuse those videos?

In Prompt, describe exactly what the camera sees and what happens during the 8 seconds.

Prompt tips that work well\
‚Ä¢ State camera first: ‚Äúhandheld close-up,‚Äù ‚Äútripod medium-wide,‚Äù ‚Äúslow dolly-in,‚Äù ‚Äústatic 3/4 angle.‚Äù\
‚Ä¢ Give one clear action that fits in 8 seconds.\
‚Ä¢ Name the setting and time of day; add simple lighting notes.\
‚Ä¢ If framing matters, say what‚Äôs in frame (e.g., ‚Äúwaist-up,‚Äù ‚Äúfull body,‚Äù ‚Äúsubject off-center left‚Äù).\
‚Ä¢ Keep it realistic; avoid vague adjectives.

The more precise your prompt is, the more likely it is to look as you want.

<Tip>
  If you want to reuse those shots in your avatar videos, they will appear in the "assets" tab and saty available in the studio when uploading files.
