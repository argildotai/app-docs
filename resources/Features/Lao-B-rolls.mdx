### Adding B-rolls or medias to a clip

To enrich your videos, you can add image or video B-rolls to your video - they can be placed automatically by our algorithm or you can place them yourself on a specific clip. You can also upload your own media.&#x20;

<Tip>
  Toggling "Auto b-rolls" in the script screen will automatically populate your video with B-rolls in places that our AI magic editing finds the most relevant&#x20;
</Tip>

### There are 4 types of B-rolls&#x20;

<Warning>
  Supported formats for uploads are **jpg, png, mov, mp4** with a maximum size of **50mb.**
  You can use websites such as [freeconvert](https://www.freeconvert.com/) if your image/video is in the wrong format or too heavy.
</Warning>

  <Step title="Adjust settings">
    You can pick 2 settings: display and length

    1. Display: this will either display the image **in front of your avatar** or **behind your avatar**. Very convenient when you wish to have yourself speaking

    2. Length: if the moment is too long

### B-roll options

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Display (placing b-roll behind avatar)" defaultOpen={false}>
    Sometimes, you may want your avatar to be visible and speaking while showing the media - in order to do this, the **display** option is available.&#x20;

    1. Display "front" will place the image **in front** of your avatar, thus hiding it

    2. Display "back" will place the image **behind** your avatar, showing it speaking while the image is playing
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Length" defaultOpen={false}>
    If the clip is too long, you may wish that the b-roll doesn't display for its full length. For this, an option exists to **cut the b-roll in half** of its duration. Just click on "Length: 1/2". We will add more options in the future.



    Note that for dynamic and engaging videos, we advise to avoid making specific clips too long - see our editing tips below&#x20;
