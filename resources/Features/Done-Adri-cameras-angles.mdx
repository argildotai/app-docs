### What are camera angles?&#x20;

Some of our avatars have a face camera but also a side one (UGC don't). These different angles switch every clip to create more dynamic videos.&#x20;

### How to pick a camera angle on a clip?

In your studio, click on the clip you need to change the angle of. Then click on "camera" on the top right and chose another angle.&#x20;

### Create a camera angle on your personal avatar

You need to record yourself two times at the same spot: once from the front, once from an angle (30 degrees maximum from the side).&#x20;
It doesn't need to be at the same time but try to chain recordings so everything looks the same (light, your hair, etc.)
