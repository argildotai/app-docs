### What is body language ?

This is the feature that allows your avatar to move a certain way with specific gestures or emotions. You can modify the body language for each moment by selecting a clip and then clicking on the panel on the right in the studio.&#x20;

We have an algorithm that matches the meaning of your script with the gestures available on a given avatar for more realistic results.&#x20;

Tip: if you press "enter" in a paragraph, it will divide it into two and allow you to use another gesture.&#x20;

### What is offset?&#x20;

Offset allows you to move frames one by one to make a gesture happen at the exact moment you say a specific word. 0.5 seconds amounts to approximately offsetting 15 frames.&#x20;

If the gesture happens too late, after what the avatar says, then click on the arrow on the right. >
If the gesture happens too early, before what the avatar says, then click on the arrow on the left \<
