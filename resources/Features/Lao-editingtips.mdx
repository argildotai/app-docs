###

Editing will transform a boring video into a really engaging one. Thankfully, you can use our many features to **very quickly** make a video more engaging.

<Tip>
  Cutting your sentences in 2 clips and playing with zooms & B-rolls is the easiest way to add dynamism to your video - and increase engagement metrics
</Tip>

### Use zooms wisely

Zooms add heavy emphasis to anything you say. We <u>advise to cut your sentences in 2 to add zooms</u>. Think of it as the video version of adding underlining or bold to a part of your sentence to make it more impactful.&#x20;

Instead of this:

```
And at the end of his conquest, he was named king
```

Prefer a much more dynamic and heavy

```
And at the end of his conquest
[zoom in] He was named king
```

### Make shorter clips&#x20;

In the TikTok era, we are used to dynamic editing - an avatar speaking for 20 seconds with nothing else on screen will have the viewer bored.&#x20;

Prefer <u>cutting your scripts in short sentences</u>, or even cutting the sentences in 2 to add a zoom, a camera angles or a B-roll.&#x20;

### Add more B-rolls

B-rolls and media will enrich the purpose of your video - thankfully, <u>you don't need to prompt to add a B-roll</u> on Argil. Simply click the "shuffle" button to rotate until you find a good one.&#x20;

<Note>
  B-rolls will take the length of the clip you append it to. If it is too long, toggle the "1/2" button on it to make it shorter&#x20;
</Note>

### Create an avatar with body language

Your AI avatar will be <u>much more engaging</u> if it can convey more expressivity through expressions and movement. Thankfully, our Pro clients can add body language & expressivity segments to their avatars.

### Use a "Pro voice"

To have a voice <u>that respects your tone and emotion</u>, we advise recording a "pro voice" and linking it to your avatar.

### Record your voice instead of typing text

It is much easier to record your voice than to film yourself, and <u>voice to video gives the best results</u>. You can <u>transform your voice into any avatar's voice</u>, and our "AI cleanup" will remove background noises and echo.&#x20;
