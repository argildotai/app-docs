### Create a pro voice

Pro voices are the best voices available on the market to clone the way you talk. They are ideal for hyper realistic results. Here is how to do create and add them (video tutorial below):&#x20;

* Subscribe to their creator plan

* Upload 30 minutes of audio of yourself: no pauses, hesitations and background noises. Talk the way you want your avatar to sound like.&#x20;

* Create an API key and copy paste it in "voices" > "Elevenlabs" on Argil

* Then go edit your avatar and link your Pro voice
