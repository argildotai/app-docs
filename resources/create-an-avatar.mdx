### Personal avatar VS AI influencer

A personal avatar is based on your own image or picture. An AI influencer is created using your own prompts. You can directly add images or products to your AI influencer whereas it comes in a second step for the personal avatar.

### How to create a great personal avatar?

The picture you should take of yourself needs to check the following boxes:

- Have great lighting (put yourself in front of a window)
- Don't smile and if possible, have your mouth slitghtly opened like in the middle of a sentence
- All of your face should be within the frame
- **The closer you are to the camera, the better the output will be**

<Tip>
  The pictures that work best are with a single human-like face. Avoid animals or multiple people on screen (even on posters).
</Tip>

### How to generate a great AI influencer?

To create an AI influencer, you have to take care of the avatar itself and then of the setup. Lastly, you'll be able to add products or clothes to your avatar.

**Appearance**\
You have three toggles to pick from (age, gender, ethnicity) and then it is all prompting. The more details you give, the better the output will be. Don't be afraid to give it 10 to 30 lines of prompt.

**Background**\
You have two toggles to pick from (camera angle and time of day) and then it is all prompting. The more details you give, the better the output will be. Don't be afraid to give it 10 to 30 lines of prompt.

**Assets: products, logos and clothes**\
Here you can drop images of clothes, logos or products you want in the frame with your avatar. Be aware that you can always create an avatar without anything and add more styles later with the objects of your choice. \
Without prompting, we'll go with what seems to make the most sense. A bottle will be held by the avatar. But you can prompt it to define where the assets are located.

\
<u>Example:</u>\
You drop an image of a sweater as well as logo. The prompt can be "make that person wear the sweater and put the logo on the sweater".
