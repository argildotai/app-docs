### Personal avatar VS AI influencer

A personal avatar is based on your own image or picture. An AI influencer is created using your own prompts. You can directly add images or products to your AI influencer whereas it comes in a second step for the personal avatar.

### How to create a great personal avatar?

The picture you should take of yourself needs to check the following boxes: 

- Have great lighting (put yourself in front of a window)
- Don't smile and if possible, have your mouth slitghtly opened like in the middle of a sentence
- All of your face should be within the frame
- **The closer you are to the camera, the better the output will be**

<Tip>
  The pictures that work best are with a single human-like face. Avoid animals or multiple people on screen (even on posters).

### How to generate a great AI influencer?

To create an AI influencer, you have to take care of the avatar itself and then of the setup. Lastly, you'll be able to add products or clothes to your avatar.
