On Argil, to protect our customers and to comply with our “safe synthetic content guidelines”, we prevent some content to be generated. There are 3 scenarios:

- Video generated with **your** avatar: no content is restricted

### **Nudity and sexual content**

**Banned:** Content is banned when it incites unrest, promotes illegal political actions, or glorifies controversial figures without nuance. Content that polarizes communities or compromises public safety through biased narratives is flagged.

**Allowed:** Balanced discussions on political issues, provided they are neutral, educational, and avoid inflammatory language.

**Why do we restrict content?**

We have very strong contracts in place with our actors that are used as Argil’s avatars.

If you think that a video has been wrongly flagged, please send an email to [support@argil.ai](mailto:support@argil.ai) (**and ideally include the transcript of said video**).

_Please note that Argil created a feature on the platform to automatically filter the generation of prohibited content, but this feature can be too strict and in some cases doesn’t work._

### Users that violate these guidelines may see the immediate termination of their access to the Platform and a permanent ban from future use.
