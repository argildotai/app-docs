## Voice creation

You can create any voice in the "voices" panel section \> "+create voice" on the top right \> upload a 1 to 5 minutes audio file. 

<Tip>
  What is a good voice dataset?

  - no moments of silence
  - keep the tone and energy you would want your avatar to have, you can exagerate a little if needed
  - be careful not to have outside noise or microphone crackles while you record
</Tip>

<u>If you are creating an avatar, you will be presented with three options: </u>

- **select a voice :** which is from your own library, from the voices you already have
- **create my voice:** upload any audio file of yourself talking 
- **generate my voice: **pick among three voices created for you according to the person we see on your image

<Tip>
  Don't hesitate to edit your voices in the "voices" section in order to increase the speed to 1.05 or 1.1. This can make all of your videos more entertaining. 
</Tip>
