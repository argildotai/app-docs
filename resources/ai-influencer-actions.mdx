<Note>
  This will ONLY work when you select an avatar created with the builder
</Note>

### What is it?

When you pick an avatar made thanks to the builder, you can make it do all sorts of actions as B-rolls. While your avatar is talking about its day, you can illustrate each one of them with a specific video.

<Note>
  The actions are videos but **you can only preview an image**. Each image is the first frame of the video. The video will be visible after clicking on generate on the top right (10-15 minutes).

  <Step title="Add new B-rolls">
    If you want to illustrate a clip with no B-roll, simply pick "AI action" in the B-roll options and shuffle through the option. Then click "generate". \
    If that clip already has a B-roll selected, you can click on the "bin" symbol to regenerate new options.
