### Account Merger

When you created an account using Google Sign up, you will have a possibility to create another account via email \+ password with the same email adress. You will then be asked to merge accounts and need to click on yes.

<Warning>
  If you see a merger prompt during login, **click on "continue"** to proceed.
</Warning>

It means that you created your account with Google then via normal email for a second account but with the same address. This creates two different accounts that you need to merge.
