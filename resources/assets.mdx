If you are using the same images or videos quite often, uploading them to the asset section is the best way to have them all stored at the same place. 

### How do I add an image or a video to the assets?

You can either:

a) Go in the asset section on the left panel then "Upload" directly\
b) Go into create a video then "Upload media" in the next tab\
c) If you are editing a video in the studio, all the images and videos that you upload there will be stored in the assets section.
