2. Choose if your new avatar is the first one of a style category or if it should be linked to a pre-existing style category
3. Start your avatar training

### Adding Camera Angles

1. Click on the avatar that needs another camera angle
2. Click on "Add a camera"
3. Train the new camera angle

  Your videos will be automatically pre-edited with switches between the different angles available on the different clips.
