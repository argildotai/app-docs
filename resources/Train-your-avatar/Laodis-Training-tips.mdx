Recording a short video to train your avatar may be daunting but here you'll see how to have great results with a couple of minutes.&#x20;

(tip callout) the most important aspect is the lighting. Recording yourself facing a window in daylight will usually yield great results

**(heading 3) How to create a video training for your avatar**

(tip callout) to add body language, make sure to report to our page **here**

* Place yourself in a position with a source of light, ideally with a lightly decorated background (for example plants and). We advise **sitting down** with your arms resting on a desk as it is easier to control your body language.&#x20;

* Use the best microphone you have and avoid (a simple $20 wireless lavalier will be even better)

* Place a camera or recent phone across you, so as your head to be about 20-30% away from the top of the frame - make sure you are centered&#x20;

* Record 3 minutes of you speaking to the camera, **without moving your arms** - your face can move and be expressive, but avoid **jittery movements:** try being fluid

* Upload the **unedited video** (uncut, without black frames or any form of editing)

Voilà! Your video is ready. To enrich it, you can add **body language** and **expression** (devin add a link here towards the create a body language page) - available for pro avatars only.&#x20;

Here's a recap (Devin, use cards for that, the parenthesis are for the description and the rest is the title )

Centered in the shot (and head about 20% from the top) / Good lighting (facing a window or a light) / Good sound quality ($20 amazon microphone) / Static arms / No cuts or editing / Nothing coming in front of the mouth / Don't turn your head, look away or move too much / Nobody else coming in the shot&#x20;

(tip callout) if you wish to have different camera angles, you can do the exact same shooting with a camera filming from the side and upload it in the platform.&#x20;

* (link) check how to create multiple camera angles

**Important points**

**(add a callout here devin)** if you wish to have a specific background in your video, you can film yourself on a green screen, edit the background on any editing software (ex: première) and train this version of the avatar. Otherwise, use our in-built remove background feature&#x20;

* If you use accessories, such as a microphone make sure that nothing comes in front of **your mouth** during the shooting

* Make sure there are no black frames or cuts in the video&#x20;

* Nobody else should be in the frame&#x20;
