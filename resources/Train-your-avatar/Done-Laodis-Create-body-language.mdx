Adding body language and expressions to your avatar will make it incredibly more realistic and versatile for any type of video you create. This is current reserved for pro plans - if you wish to onboard this feature, please pick [a call here](https://calendly.com/adrien-argil/pro-avatar).&#x20;

(add callout here devin) Our model can't currently "invent" body language - all gestures must be shot in the training video following the process below

**How does this work**?

* Before shooting the training video, you pick up to 6 gestures or expressions you want to add

* When shooting your training video, you shoot each gesture (up to 30 seconds) with the following model:

  * First, do the gesture **once** (for example waving hello)

  * Than get your hands back to their neutral position and keep speaking until the end of the 30 seconds. Here is the example of [one gesture from one of our avatars](https://youtu.be/doC1cvNgp5c)

* Stitch together the "base video" of 2 minutes (where you are just talking to the camera) and each segment of 30 seconds that starts with a gesture and goes on with you speaking in a neutral position. [Here's the example for an entire video stitched together](https://youtu.be/_MltcxXAADw) (note the gestures every 30 seconds from the 2-minute mark)

* Upload the full video in Avatars -> Create a new avatar -> Generic avatars and follow the steps to train your avatar

Once your avatar is trained **don't forget to label the body language segments to have them in the studio!**

**How to label body language segments**

* Go to avatars, pick the avatar you wish to edit, then on the right camera, click the "..." to "Edit"

* On the following screen, you will see the entire video - play it until the moment of your first gesture (it should be at 2minutes), then click "Add gesture" and give it a name (for example "Waving)

* Repeat the process for each gesture you have in the video

(callout) You can play around with the arrows left and right of each gesture for the gesture to start exactly at the right moment&#x20;

**Congratulations**! When you create a video from the studio, you will now have access to all gestures in the tab "Body language". Feel free to change them for each clip.&#x20;
