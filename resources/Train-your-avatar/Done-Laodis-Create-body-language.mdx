<Warning>
  This feature is reserved for pro plans. [Schedule a call](https://calendly.com/adrien-argil/pro-avatar) to enable body language for your avatar.
</Warning>

<Note>
  Our model requires pre-recorded gestures - all body language must be shot in the training video following the process below.
</Note>

### Recording your training video

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose your gestures">
    Select up to 6 gestures or expressions you want to add to your avatar.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Record each gesture (30 seconds each)">
    1. Perform the gesture once clearly (e.g., waving hello)
    2. Return hands to neutral position
    3. Continue speaking naturally until the 30-second mark

    1. Record a 2-minute base video of natural talking
    2. Add your 30-second gesture segments after the base video
    3. Each gesture should appear at 30-second intervals after the 2-minute mark

    1. Go to Avatars
    2. Select your avatar
    3. Click "..." then "Edit" on the right camera
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add gesture labels">
    1. Play the video until your first gesture (around 2-minute mark)
    2. Click "Add gesture"
    3. Name your gesture (e.g., "Waving")
    4. Repeat for each gesture in the video
