## Overview

Create a new avatar from an image. Supports both URL and base64-encoded image formats. If no `voiceId` is provided, a voice design will be automatically created from the image.

## Request Body

```json
{
  "type": "IMAGE",
  "name": "<avatar_name>",
  "datasetImage": {
    "url": "https://example.com/avatar-image.jpg", // OR
    "base64": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANS..."
  },
  "voiceId": "<voice_id>",
  "extras": {
    "custom_key": "custom_value"
  }
}
```

### Image Requirements

- **Format**: PNG, JPEG, or WEBP
- **Resolution**: Between 720p (1280x720 or 720x1280) and 4K (3840x2160 or 2160x3840)
- **Aspect Ratio**: Must be exactly 16:9 (landscape) or 9:16 (portrait)
- **Max Size**: 10MB
- **Protocol**: HTTPS URLs only (for `url` field)

### Optional Fields

- `voiceId`: UUID of an existing voice to use. If not provided, a voice design will be automatically created from the image.
- `extras`: Custom metadata dictionary (max 10 key-value pairs, 256 characters each)

## Response

Returns the created Avatar object. The avatar will be created with `TRAINING` status and transition to `IDLE` when ready.

## Avatar Status

After creating an avatar, it will be in the `TRAINING` status. The avatar typically becomes ready (status changes to `IDLE`) within **30 seconds**.

**Important**: Before creating videos with a newly created avatar, you must ensure the avatar status is `IDLE`. You have two options:

### Option 1: Poll Avatar Status

Periodically check the avatar status using the [GET /avatars/{id}](/api-reference/endpoint/avatars.get) endpoint until the status is `IDLE`:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.argil.ai/v1/avatars/{avatar_id} \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Option 2: Use Webhook Events (Recommended)

Subscribe to the `AVATAR_TRAINING_SUCCESS` webhook event to receive a notification when the avatar is ready. This is the recommended approach as it avoids polling and provides real-time updates.

## Cost

Each image avatar created from API will cost **2 credits**.
